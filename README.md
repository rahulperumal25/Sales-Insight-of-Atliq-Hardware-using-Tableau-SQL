# Sales-Insight-of-Atliq-Hardware-using-Tableau-SQL

In a recent project, I utilized Tableau and SQL to create a sales dashboard, drawing insights from the Codebasics YouTube channel. The objective was to deliver actionable sales insights for better decision-making.

- **Data Extraction and Transformation**: Using SQL, I extracted and transformed data from various sources. I crafted complex queries to calculate key performance indicators such as total sales, average order value, and customer acquisition rates, establishing a solid data foundation that accurately reflected the company's sales dynamics.

- **Dashboard Design and Visualization**: In Tableau, I designed an intuitive dashboard featuring interactive charts, graphs, and filters. Users could easily explore data by region, product category, and time period, enabling deeper insights into trends and patterns.

- **Key Features**:
  - **Dynamic Sales Funnel**: Tracked the customer journey from initial interest to purchase, identifying bottlenecks and potential revenue losses.
  - **Trend Analysis and Forecasting**: Integrated trend lines and forecasting models to predict future sales based on historical data, providing valuable foresight for planning and resource allocation.

- **Best Practices from Codebasics**: I applied techniques from Codebasics, which enhanced the dashboardâ€™s functionality and impact.

The final product empowered the sales team with real-time insights, enabling data-driven decisions that significantly improved sales performance and efficiency.
