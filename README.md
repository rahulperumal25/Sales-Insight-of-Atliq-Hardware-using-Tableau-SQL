Sales Insight using Tableau &amp; SQL
In this recent project, I utilized Tableau and SQL to create a sales dashboard, drawing insights from the Codebasics YouTube channel. The objective was to deliver actionable sales insights for better decision-making.

Using SQL, I extracted and transformed data from various sources, crafting complex queries to calculate key performance indicators like total sales, average order value, and customer acquisition rates. This provided a solid data foundation reflecting the company's sales dynamics.

In Tableau, I designed an intuitive dashboard with interactive charts, graphs, and filters, allowing users to explore data by region, product category, and time period. A standout feature was the dynamic sales funnel, which tracked the customer journey from initial interest to purchase, highlighting bottlenecks and potential revenue losses. I also integrated trend lines and forecasting models to predict future sales based on historical data.

Throughout the project, I applied techniques from Codebasics, enhancing the dashboardâ€™s functionality and impact. The final product empowered the sales team with real-time insights, enabling data-driven decisions that boosted sales performance and efficiency.
